                <p>
                  Read our policy, which sets out our terms for your use of
                  Konnect-Mates's social network community. We have created some
                  terms and conditions (the Rules) which set out the terms for
                  your use of Konnect-Mates&rsquo;s Global social network
                  community, which currently spans comments on Konnect-Mates
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                  Please read the following Rules carefully, as they provide
                  information about using the Community in a way that is
                  respectful and lawful. By using, or submitting material to,
                  the Community you agree that have read, understood, accept,
                  and agree to abide by, these Rules.
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                  The terms, conditions and policies that apply to the
                  Konnect-Mates profiles they host. We recommend that you
                  familiarise yourself with those terms and conditions before
                  participating in the Community and we disclaim any liability
                  associated with your use of those services, or for your
                  failure to view or comply with their terms, conditions and
                  policies. Where there is a conflict between these Rules and
                  the terms and conditions of the relevant social network
                  channels, the social network channels&rsquo; terms and
                  conditions will prevail.

                <h3>Moderation of the community</h3>
                We strive to create dialogue with users of our Community and
                encourage you to share content via the Community in accordance
                with these Rules (Contribution). To help us do that, we try to
                monitor the Community during normal Global business hours
                (9am-5pm GMT, Monday to Friday, excluding Global public
                holidays).&nbsp;
                <p>
                  We will try to check that all submissions to the Community
                  comply with our acceptable use standards described below
                  (Acceptable Use Standards) as soon as reasonably practicable
                  after publication.
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                  If in our opinion an individual makes use of the Community in
                  breach of these Rules, we reserve the right to remove, or to
                  disable access to, any Contribution, and to terminate, suspend
                  or change the conditions of their access to the Community
                  without prior warning. We also reserve the right to bring
                  legal proceedings against any individual for a breach of the
                  Rules, or take such other action as we reasonably deem
                  appropriate.
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                  We expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage
                  arising from the use of the Community by any person in
                  contravention of these Rules.
                  <br />
                  While we try to moderate the Community, we are not legally
                  responsible for any material posted by third parties and we
                  may stop, or suspend, moderating the Community at any time.

                <ul>
                  <li className="dot-rte">
                    The views expressed by any individual within the Community
                    are those of the individual and do not necessarily reflect
                    the views of Konnect-Mates.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li className="dot-rte">
                    Any medical advice or information posted to the Community
                    should not be regarded as advice on which any reliance
                    should be placed. We therefore disclaim all liability and
                    responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such
                    materials by a user of the Community, or by anyone who may
                    be informed of any of its contents. You must always seek
                    medical advice from your doctor or a suitably qualified
                    medical professional.
                  </li>
                  <li className="dot-rte">
                    Any advice or information posted to the Community should not
                    be accepted as true or correct. It is up to individual users
                    to check the validity of any advice or information before
                    relying on it, especially where the consequences of
                    following it could be serious.
                  </li>
                  <li className="dot-rte">
                    Sometimes Konnect-Mates automatically follows back users
                    which follow Konnect-Mates profiles within the Community. A
                    follow-back does not constitute an endorsement; the same
                    applies to re-tweeting or sharing messages posted on
                    accounts that Konnect-Mates does not own, or marking them as
                    'favourites', or otherwise sharing information on a
                    different platform.

                <h3>Minors</h3>
                <p>
                  The Community is intended for use by individuals aged 18 years
                  or more. Minors must get permission from their parent or
                  guardian before using the Community. We recommend that parents
                  who allow their children to use the Community discuss online
                  safety with their children first and that parents endeavour to
                  monitor any use of the Community. Minors should also be given
                  guidance on how to use the Community safely and in a way that
                  complies with these Rules.
