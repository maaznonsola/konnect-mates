Regular Dependency: for regular use-> npm i
"bcryptjs": password encryption, never stores password in plain text
"config": for global variables
"express": web framework for backend
"express-validator": for data validation, if we request for field via postman which is not present then raise error
"gravatar": profile avatar (email associate avatar will show)
"jsonwebtoken": JWT token for validation
"mongoose": layer to interact with database
"request": make http request to another api (for github api feature)

Dev Dependency: for dev use-> npm i -D
"nodemon": to watch server so that we dont have to refresh everytime when change something
"concurrently": to allow running backend(express) and frontend(react) server at the same time

---to check express is running---
write script in server.js
npm run server (it will run nodemon by listning PORT) PS: server is because package.json contain script as server for nodemon
